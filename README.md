# AngularJS 

With the guidance from Lynda tutorials, I had a go with understanding and using AngularJS. 
In this project I learned what is AngularJS framework is, and how it help me build simple web 
applications faster and more efficently. Also I gain an understanding of what MVC architecture is, 
which forms the foundation of AngularJS projects. In other words, models which are nothing more than
your data, views which is how the data is flowed into a template, and controllers which is the JavaScript 
that links the two together.

I learned how to divide my project into different modules and how to work with Angular services like http, 
routeProvider and anmiation. Also I learned some advance features of the framework like deep linking,
creating routes, working with different plugin modules like the animation module. Overall with AngularJS
I created a directory search application in this project.
